A few months before she passed away, while under heavy cancer treatment, she presented her research to two conferences: a paper “Reflexive Subjectivity: An Ethnography of Transnational Chinese Professionals” at the American Association of Behavioral and Social Sciences conference, and another paper “Understanding the Digital Tribe: Ethnographic Methods and Chinese High-technology Professionals” was presented to the annual Ethnographic & Qualitative Research Conference.

He received his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Occidental College and his Ph.D. at UCLA. He also held honorary degrees from nine other distinguished universities across the country. In 1940, Dr. Dumke began his 42-year career in higher education as an instructor of history at Occidental College. He went on to become a professor of history and dean of the faculty at Occidental College before becoming president of San Francisco State College in 1957. While serving as president, Dr. Dumke was one of the principal architects of the Master Plan for Higher Education in California, which became the blueprint for the State’s higher education system. Under Dr. Dumke’s leadership, the university system made great progress in the breadth and quality of academic programs. Quoting a former CSU chancellor, “He organized 16 separate academic programs into a single system that became a model across the nation… it happened because Dr. Dumke was a visionary leader.”\nThe purpose of this fellowship is to encourage student scholars to engage in graduate work in fields such as public policy, American history, economics, archival management and government.

People working at the television stations in Sacramento, CA; Columbus, OH; San Diego, CA; and San Francisco, CA where he presided as news director knew him as Sanders. He was a leader, not just a manager. As one former employee said about Sanders after his death in September 2015, “Sanders was all about integrity. From the choice and quality of the stories he put on the air to his mentoring of countless people in all areas of news, he operated from a base of encouragement, never negativity. From a heart full of courage instead of fear. Sanders didn’t force you to do your best, he made you want to do your best. And he led by example, holding himself up to the highest standard and trusting that his people would rise to their highest potential. I am not unique in my love and admiration for this funny, charismatic, intelligent man; there are many of us who would have followed Jim Sanders anywhere.” This scholarship is to honor and support the leaders of today and tomorrow among the California State University student population.
